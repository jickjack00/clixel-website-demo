It will take a while to fill it all up but when it's done it will look OK. Have you ever heard or played of Nubby's Number Factory? It's a game inspired by the old design of Windows '98 type stuff, and it's a pinball-like roguelike. It's kind of like pinball but it's also not, is what I mean by pinball-like. It's honestly pretty difficult but it's very fun and has a pleasant soundtrack. Like pleasant park from fortnite. Guys i'm hip. Honestly I think Fortnite is pretty mid though I did buy the Hatsune Miku skins as well as the Peter Griffin skins because I think it's really funny. Even if I don't play the game. It's still fun cuz it hella ragebaits people and it's funny.</p>
