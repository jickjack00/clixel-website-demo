It will take a while to fill it all up but when it's done it will look OK. Have you ever heard or played of Nubby's Number Factory? It's a game inspired by the old design of Windows '98 type stuff, and it's a pinball-like roguelike. It's kind of like pinball but it's also not, is what I mean by pinball-like. It's honestly pretty difficult but it's very fun and has a pleasant soundtrack. Like pleasant park from fortnite. Guys i'm hip. Honestly I think Fortnite is pretty mid though I did buy the Hatsune Miku skins as well as the Peter Griffin skins because I think it's really funny. Even if I don't play the game. It's still fun cuz it hella ragebaits people and it's funny. Here's a super large super big placeholder text section. Play Balatro it's really good. I like playing it because it's satisfying to use large mixes of good Jokers (essentially, upgrades) to find out what kind of scores I can get. Though I've never really made it past Ante 10, I love playing endless too. It's fun to try and go as high as you can. In addition play Titanfall 2 god that game is so good and it's really cool but I think the game is kinda dead since the devs abandoned it and so now the game is filled with hypersweats. Well gg i guess. You can still play the singleplayer and there's a pve mode but whatever</p>

                    <p>Test text did you know that I actually don't really like coding anymore I wanna get into being a guitarist that sounds so freaking cool but I won't be able to act on it for a while which really sucks. I mean i guess it's fine but it's pretty obnoxious since I kinda just wanna give up on coding as a whole. By guitarist I mean like electric guitars or something but tbh bass works too. Bass also seems cool. Drums also seem cool but that's like a final backup type thing. Am I still making placeholder t yes i am why am I asking that question of course I am. That aside you need to see Bocchi The Rock! that show is awesome and i've been obsessed with it and it kind of may or may not have sparked this interest in musical creation but whatever it happens to everyone doesn't it. If it doesn't happen to you then you probably like sitting in a cuck chair all day looking at a screen typing words you don't even understand. Which is exactly why I don't like coding anymore.</p>
