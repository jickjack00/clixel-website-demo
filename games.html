                        more filler text. a lot more filler text. so much filler text that the developer got tired of writing it and they had to hire a new one. i'm writing this filler text. why not talk about something while i'm at it? well, i don't know what to talk about is the issue. that's okay, give me some time to think and i might be able to come up with something! just give me a while longer. who knows, maybe by the time i finish thinking it'll be enough. have you watched mario forever title theme from silvagunner? fire beat icl. welcome to pizza hut was an insane line honestly, put me in tears. you know you should totally watch it. actually, here you go <a href="https://youtu.be/OOMfqWKEJ0Y">https://youtu.be/OOMfqWKEJ0Y</a> go ahead and watch it, it's super fun and i know you're putting that in your playlist after. lwk goated track. on the topic actually you should genuinely listen to balatro's ost. it's only got like one track but holy it has several variations and all of them are so good. you should play balatro in general. it's very fun and i would recommend it. another good roguelike is risk of rain 2, OUHGH risk of rain 2. risk of rain 2 is so so so good and you HAVE to play it.
