                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">We are an indie game development studio set on making accessible high-quality games and pushing the boundaries of game development with each release, with no catches. We believe that the quality of the game comes first and that satisfying customers should be a main priority so we spare no effort in making each game the best it can be. With this goal in mind, players can experience the next generation of games without bugs or glitches to disrupt the immersion and enjoyment each game brings.<br><br>
                    <span style="font-size: 22px;"><u>With Clixel, the best games are only a couple Clix away.</u></span></p><br><br>
                    <h2 style="font-size: 32px;"><u>Endless Ways to Play</u></h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">We build our games with several control schemes in mind so that anyone can enjoy them how they want. The optimisation of our games also makes them playable on countless machines. We don't leave optimisation up to the player and we don't rely on external developers to create ways to freely reduce the optimisation we need to do. It's up to us, as the developers, hand-make every experience perfectly, and that's what we do.</p>
